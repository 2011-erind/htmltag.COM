    <h2>TABLE TAG</h2>

    <p>The "table" tag defines an HTML table.

        An HTML table consists of one "table" element and one or more "tr", "th", and "td" elements.
        
        The "tr" element defines a table row, the "th" element defines a table header, and the "td" element defines a table cell.
        
        An HTML table may also include "caption", "colgroup", "thead", "tfoot", and "tbody" elements.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">THEAD TAG</h2>
     
    <p style="text-align: center;">The  "thead" tag is used to group header content in an HTML table.

      The "thead" element is used in conjunction with the "tbody" and "tfoot" elements to specify each part of a table
         (header, body, footer).
      
      Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer. 
      Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages,
       these elements can enable the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
      
      Note: The "thead" element must have one or more "tr" tags inside.
      
      The "thead" tag must be used in the following
         context: As a child of a "table" element, after any "caption" and "colgroup" elements, and before any "tbody", "tfoot", and
         "tr" elements.
      
      Tip: The "thead", "tbody", and "tfoot" elements will not affect the layout of the table by default. However, you can use
         CSS to style these elements (see example below)!</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">TH TAG</h2>

      <p style="text-align: center;">The "th" tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.

        An HTML table has two kinds of cells:
        
        Header cells - contains header information (created with the "th" element)
        Data cells - contains data (created with the "td" element)
        The text in "th" elements are bold and centered by default.
        
        The text in td" elements are regular and left-aligned by default</p>

      The "tfoot" element is used in conjunction with the "thead" and "tbody"
         elements to specify each part of a table (footer, header, body).
      
      Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer.
       Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages,
       these elements can enable the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
